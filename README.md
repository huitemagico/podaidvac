IDEA: "Process-Oriented DAO with AI Definition and Verification of Acceptance Criteria"
by HuiteMagico, January 28, 2025

(1) What is the problem?
Many public and private resources for social projects are wasted on poorly executed work or lost to fraud.


The Vision:
A blockchain-based project to create and manage a Process-Oriented DAO with AI Definition and Verification of Acceptance Criteria (PODAIDVAC).
This DAO will:
    1. Collect resources.
    2. Identify projects.
    3. Draft and manage acceptance criteria effectively.
With integrated AI tools, it will verify whether the initial acceptance criteria (also AI-assisted) are met throughout the project lifecycle.
For transparency, the DAO will publicly display contracts and project milestones.
While this framework can be applied to any project, such as IT initiatives, this proposal focuses on addressing resource scarcity for senior citizens by developing a PODAIDVAC—effectively transforming it into a Charitable DAO to tackle this issue.


Background
Note: Data and characteristics are based on Chile.
    1. High percentage of elderly citizens with limited resources:
        ◦ Senior citizens make up 22% of the total population (~4 million people).
    2. Social and family situation of senior citizens in urban areas:
        ◦ In major cities, where most seniors live, their role in family or social life is often minimized due to the work schedules of younger family members.
        ◦ Seniors with physical or mental health issues face even greater challenges. Wealthier families can afford private care homes, while others rely on charity organizations.

RESULTS or HOW THE PROCESS FLOW WORKS
1. Identifying donors and projects:
    • The DAO system processes and publishes data about communities in need from government and private institutions.
    • This information is publicly available online, allowing two-way communication. Community representatives can chat with potential donors and share their situation via video conferences.
    • All conferences are recorded and analyzed by an AI assistant to draft the project’s acceptance criteria.

2. Project selection:
    • Donors and community representatives work together to choose a project, like building a new dining hall.
    • The AI assistant helps draft acceptance criteria (e.g., size, materials, deadlines), which are recorded in the DAO’s smart contracts.
    • As the project moves forward, stakeholders provide updates like invoices, photos, and videos of materials, all stored in the DAO.
    • When milestones are reached, the smart contract verifies the conditions and releases funds. This continues until the project is completed.


In summary, The idea aligns with the goals of creativity, the mission to make financial services more accessible, and is a real-world application.
(1)financial access
Expanding 'borders' to include economic, cultural, and social boundaries, this idea and project enable direct resource transfers to individuals or institutions.

(2)   make financial services more accessible
For marginalized communities or elderly individuals, access to everyday financial services means that each day in their later years can be better, thanks to an efficient flow of funds.

(3) 3) Real-world Application:
The idea and project are relevant and practical, as the rapid evolution of AI makes integrating it into smart contracts feasible.
